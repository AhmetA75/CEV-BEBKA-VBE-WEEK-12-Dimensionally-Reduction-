CEV-BEBKA-VBE-WEEK-12

TASK-12A: Please use linear (PCA) and nonlinear (LLE, ISOMAP) dimensionality reduction methods using MR metrics to visualize the patients with their different CDRGLOB values/levels to understand whether there are visible patterns. Please first only use the first two dimensions in your visualizations.

TASK-12B: Please develop 3 separate predictive models with respect to the datasets with reduced dimensions (but use dimension/component number as 7) in part-A. Then use 3 different algorithms to provide classification models to predict CDRGLOB and compare the outputs of these 9 models. (train-test split = 0.75 and 0.25) 3 algorithms are Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM (rbf), and RandomForestClassifier 

For this task, please use them with their default parameter values and provide the classification report and confusion matrix for each of these.

TASK-12C: Please combine these four datasets (pca-iso-lle-tsne) and then use an algorithm of your interest separately on this dataset to predict the CDRGLOB values while using grid search to optimize the hyperparameters. Please use the first 5 components from each of these 4 datasets. Please do not forget to apply minmax scaling before the dimensionality reduction operations. 

TASK-12D: Please use the new dataset (selected) beginning with the 16th column after scaling it with minmax scaler. Then apply the k-means algorithm on the scaled dataset for k=4 and then visualize it with respect to their labels on 2 dimensions obtained via tSNE. 

TASK-12E: Please use the silhouette algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters (k=2, 3, 4, â€¦. 50). Please visualize the silhouette scores within this range and decide the most appropriate cluster number. Then apply the suitable cluster number using K-means. 

TASK-12F: Please use the final dataset but this time add the following columns and then run the model with grid search optimization:
-	SEX
-	INDEPEND
-	NPISCORE
-	FAQ

TASK-12G: Then for comparison purposes, use only these four columns to develop a model):

-	SEX
-	INDEPEND
-	NPISCORE
-	FAQ
